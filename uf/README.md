# University of Florida Sample Data

The [University of Florida](http://ufl.edu) has shared a snapshot of its VIVO data with the VIVO community.

The data contains information on people, grants, journals, organizations, buildings, 
courses taught, journals, books, services, and many other types of scholarly works.  The data provides
a good example of organization structure. It does not contain photographs, or university id numbers.

This is real world data.  It is not offered as an example of how to create and model VIVO data.  
It is offered as a "stress test" of VIVO, providing a large scale data set with many edge cases,
and potential data integrity issues.

It is offered "as is."

The UF VIVO snapshot data contains 14.3M triples.
